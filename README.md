# .NET Open GL Helpers

Just the outcome of some hobbyist mucking about with [OpenGL.Net]().

* Core: A few low-level classes that wrap around the static API classes presented by OpenGL.Net (OpenGL.Net - the source at least - does include some higher-level classes, but they aren't really to my taste)
* Views: Building on top of Core, a simple-to-the-point-of-naivety rendering engine.

Plenty of comments etc - mostly for my own benefit..
